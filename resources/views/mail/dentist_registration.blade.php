<p>The Component Societies of Kingston, Ottawa and Toronto are coordinating the media releases for their area.  If your school is located outside these cities, please help us promote Brush-a-mania and oral health by inviting the media to your presentation.  You may use the template media releases on our website:  <a href="https://brushamania.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Press-Release-1-1.doc">Press Release 1</a>; <a href="https://brushamania.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Press-Release-2-1.doc">Press Release 2</a>. You may also contact your Mayor to declare April Oral Health Month in your municipality:  <a href="https://brushamania.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/Letter-Proclamation-Request.doc">Mayoral Proclamation Request</a>.</p>

<p>Any elementary student (JK to Grade 6) anywhere in Canada may register and record each time they brush their teeth on our website.  Everyone who brushes and/or flosses their teeth 100 times within any 30 day period will be emailed a Brush-a-mania certificate of achievement.  His or her name will be entered into our draw to win an Xbox One or one of fifty tablets.  The goal is to encourage the students to develop good oral hygiene habits at an early age.  Please encourage your patients to participate by distributing these <a href="https://brushamania.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/Postcard.pdf">postcards</a> in your office.  Please let me know how may you would like and we will ship them for free with your school supplies.</p>
