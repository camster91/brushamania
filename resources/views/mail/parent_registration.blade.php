<p>Thank you {{$parent->firstname}} {{$parent->lastname}} for registering for Brush-a-mania 2020!</p>

<p>You and your child/children have taken on the challenge to help promote proper oral heath in your household, as well as, among your community. We thank you for your participation and hope that you have fun during the month of April – Oral Health Month tracking your brushes and flosses.</p>

<p>You can track your child/children’s brushes and flosses just by going to <a href="https://app.brushamania.ca/login">https://app.brushamania.ca/login</a> and entering your email address and password. You have until 12am (midnight) to record the previous day’s brushes and flosses.</p>

<p>All elementary students up to grade 6 who brush and/or floss their teeth 100 times within any 30 day period will be emailed a Brush-a-mania certificate of achievement.  His or her name will be entered into our draw to win an Xbox One or one of fifty tablets.</p>

<p>Any elementary student in Canada up to grade 6 may enter.  The contest closes May 31, 2020.  Winners will be notified after June 7 and all winners’ first name and name of their school will be posted on our website.  Prizes will be sent to your child’s school for presentation.  We wish you all good luck and remember to have fun while you brush and floss!</p>

<p>With our primary goal being to help promote proper oral heath, if your child happens to forget recording his/her brushes, you have the ability to restart their 30 day tracking period. Please remember the recording of brushes online begins April 1st and closes May 31st.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact my co-chair Jennifer Boyd at jennifer@brushamania.ca.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for promoting good oral health.</p>
