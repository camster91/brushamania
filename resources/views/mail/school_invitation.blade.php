<p>Hello {{$school_name}}, Dr. {{$dentist->firstname}} {{$dentist->lastname}} has requested that your school be part of the Brush-a-mania program this year. <a href="http://app.brushamania.ca/school-registration?invite_token={{$invite_token}}">Please register here</a>.</p>

<p>Join us as we Celebrate 20 Years of Brush-a-mania
April is a very special month in Canada.  It is Oral Health Month! What better way to recognize Oral Health Month than to have your students participate in a fun and educational program.</p>

<p>Brush-a-mania is a not-for-profit program designed to promote oral health and awareness among young children from Junior Kindergarten to grade 6.  It was started in 2001 by the Scarborough Rotary Passport Club and has already reached over 800,000 students.  Our goal is to educate and motivate children and to bring together dentists, Rotarians, teachers and parents to create a celebration around proper dental care.</p>

<p>If you choose to participate, your school would hold an assembly during the month of April, where a dentist and a Rotarian will come into the school and provide the children with an interactive, entertaining presentation in proper dental care. Each student will receive a Colgate toothbrush and toothpaste, a Brush-a-mania instruction pamphlet and a Brush-a-mania sticker.  The assembly will conclude with a Brush-off where all participants “brush their teeth” simultaneously for 3 minutes.  (Optional)</p>

<p>The students are encouraged to track their brushes for 30 days in the classroom and at home online.  When the students complete the online program, they will be be emailed a Brush-a-mania certificate of achievement.   His or her name will be entered into our draw to win an Xbox One or one of fifty tablets.</p>

<p>I hope that you agree Brush-a-mania will benefit your students and will consider this program for your school.  If you have any questions please contact my co-chair Jennifer Boyd at jennifer@brushamania.ca.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for promoting good oral health.</p>
